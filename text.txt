I was diagnosed with aspergers when I was 6 years old and had to be trained by a speech therapist to talk properly. Now, there came a time when my school was hosting a grade-wide soccer tournament. I loved being the goalie, and was actually good at is as a grade-schooler, and I put myself on the sign-up list. The teams were randomly selected, and I was selected to be on a team as a goalie!
